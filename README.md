# FastDisa

## Synopsis
FastDisa is being created to duplicate the features of Google Voice for mobile users with the help of Asterisk and XMPP.

**Call Routing**

It contacts the Asterisk server over the internet and configures the call routing. When your phone dials, it dials your Asterisk server which follows the route.

If internet is not available, the app will still dial though using DTMF tones to route the call.

**SMS Support**

    WORK IN PROGRESS

The app will be an XMPP (Jabber) client which connects to a server configured to send and receive SMS messages.

See [The Project Brief](/ProjectBrief.md) for more info.
